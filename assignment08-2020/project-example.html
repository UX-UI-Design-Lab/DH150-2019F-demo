Introduction: 
      Deok_UP is an app to teach Korean through Korean Popular Culture Content. Deok_UP (덕업) is from the word 덕후 in Korean that means "fan" and 업 is a play on the word "UP" pronounced as 업 in Korean, but also a way to allude at the expression "덕업일치" that means "when something you enjoy becomes your work." - This saying kind of reflects well my wish to make people able to reach their personal/professional goal of learning Korean in an enjoyable way, and that's why I decided this name.</p>

      <p>With the COVID-19 pandemic, we have entered a period of time when people are facing instability and uncertainty. As Los Angeles continues to be in a state of lockdown, more people are experiencing negative emotions such as anxiety and fear. Although middle-aged women are not usually under the spotlight of the social realm of discussion, they are a group that cannot be neglected. Focusing on the happiness of middle-aged women, I hope to, in this project, explore a way of providing an outlet of the real world. By improving the user experience, it can make sure these users can find the process of using the product enjoyable and that the overall experience brings happiness.</p>

     I conducted four usability tests among my classmates to detect major problems and objectively see, from a user’s perspective, how the product works. These usability tests were conducted over Zoom and with the permission of the participants, their screen and facial expressions were recorded. 
<br>
<p class="card-title">Main Findings: </p>

<ul>
<li> All participants were able to complete the three tasks.</li>
<li>Home screen fonts were too small.</li>
<li>Some participants had a hard time getting to the "done" button after adding a book to their "want to read" bookshelf.</li>
<li>Some participants had a hard time finding the "share" button.</li>
<li>The "write a book log" was the function least likely to be used by these participants.</li>
<li>Adjectives used the most frequently to describe this app were: creative, familiar, and trustworthy.</li>

    Conclusion

  <div class="card-body">
    <blockquote class="blockquote mb-0">
      <p>I learned several things during my DH 150 project on the UCLA Bruins app. <br><br> 
        Tradeoffs: UX design is all about tradeoffs. In choosing whether or not to include certain information into my designs, I was constantly faced with dilemmas: do I add more information and make the interface slightly more cluttered, or do I retain the minimalist look at the expense of the interfaces informativeness? In the end, it was about finding the right balance in every decision I made. Thus, I learned that you cannot have everything, and the tradeoffs you make will largely depend on the function of certain elements and the purpose of your app (e.g. I prioritized information over minimalism on the team profile interface because this interface is meant to inform the user on a team’s season performance.)</p>
