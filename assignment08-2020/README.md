#### DH150: UX+UI, by Hermann Hesse

### Introduction

Deok_UP is an app to teach Korean through Korean Popular Culture Content. Deok_UP (덕업) is from the word 덕후 in Korean that means "fan" and 업 is a play on the word "UP" pronounced as 업 in Korean, but also a way to allude at the expression "덕업일치" that means "when something you enjoy becomes your work." - This saying kind of reflects well my wish to make people able to reach their personal/professional goal of learning Korean in an enjoyable way, and that's why I decided this name.

### Design statement 

With the COVID-19 pandemic, we have entered a period of time when people are facing instability and uncertainty. As Los Angeles continues to be in a state of lockdown, more people are experiencing negative emotions such as anxiety and fear. Although middle-aged women are not usually under the spotlight of the social realm of discussion, they are a group that cannot be neglected. Focusing on the happiness of middle-aged women, I hope to, in this project, explore a way of providing an outlet of the real world. By improving the user experience, it can make sure these users can find the process of using the product enjoyable and that the overall experience brings happiness.

### Competitor analysis: Heuristic Evaluation

Designing a new and accessible website for libraries in the midst of a pandemic is significant in continuing to help patrons. Many are sheltering at home and institutions, such as libraries, remain closed to the public and;therefore, are forced to redesign their services. With services going online, the digital divide is apparent. It makes it more difficult when a library's websites are difficult to navigate and overwhelming to use. Focusing on the two major library systems in Los Angeles, I will be evaulating both Los Angeles Public Library and LA County Library's website in order to design a more simple and easy to use website for middle-age patron who indentify as female.

### Competitor analysis: Usability Testing
The purpose of usability testing (UT) is to identify issues with the product design and improve the overall usability and satisfaction of a product. In contrast to heuristic evaluation, UT provides a more accurate inspection of how a random participant would interact with a product. It is necessary to test whether a product is effective, efficient, and satisfactory for users. The UT process can also inform potential users about the unreleased project, as well as help identify problems in the interface early, eliminating possible future spending and damage control.

### User research: contextual inquiry
Based off the initial findings of the [Mathisfun.com](https://www.mathsisfun.com/) [heuristic evaluation](https://github.com/elco7985/DH250-Romero_Garrett/tree/main/Assignment%2001) and [pilot usability test](https://github.com/elco7985/DH250-Romero_Garrett/tree/main/Assignment%2002), the research has reached its next phase of data collection. The research that takes place is based on participant observation and contextual inquiry user experience methodology that is focused at collecting qualitative data towards facilitating effective math learning lessons to students in and outside of classroom learning. Specifically, the research observes and explores the tools, strategies, and pain points of teaching math to a group of elementary school children by a female, middle-aged teacher based in Los Angeles, California. The ultimate goal is to identify translatable qualitative data that can be used to help improve and/or create new features pertaining to the Mathisfun.com website.

### UX storytelling

The purposes of UX Storytelling are:
- To understand the user through putting yourself in their shoes and seeing it from their perspective
- To Provide insight about the user, their behavior, story, and pain points
- To Allows the team to design a product that focuses on the user

Design Features I would suggest are: 
- Ingredients search bar: Clear and easily accessible search bar for users to add ingredients
- Grocery list: Allows users to add missing ingredients into a list (not present, would be a useful implementation)
- Filter: Obvious filter that has clear filter categories

###### Mary is a mother of two and wants to do the most to make her kids happy and healthy. However, she has never learned how to cook so she only knows how to make 5 dishes, which her kids get tired of and aren’t the healthiest. She tries to buy lots of ingredients to attempt to add to the dishes she knows how to make, but it always fails so some ingredients go bad in the fridge. Thus, she wants to know how to learn how to cook and make new dishes using the ingredients she buys. She also wants to make sure the dishes are suitable for kids.

###### To cook breakfast for her kids, Mary turns on her personal laptop and goes onto the SuperCook site. She opens her fridge and looks at all the ingredients she has. She has chicken breasts, american cheese, onions, green beans, spinach, ground beef, flour, sugar, potato, vegetable oil, and olive oil. She presses on the categories, which expand and shows ingredients. She proceeds and marks all the ingredients she has in her fridge using the checkbox beside each of them. As she does so, the page refreshes to show the recipe of dishes she can make. The page shows that she can make 900+ dishes with her 11 ingredients. Mary sees that there are so many options and is intimidated. She notices that there is a filter on the page, and clicks on age range to narrow down her searches. She is able to select toddler & preschool to identify what age range her kids are in. This way, she is able to make sure these dishes are suitable for her kids. Once she selects the filters, the page refreshes, and narrows down the recipes to displays ones that are safe for her kids. She clicks on the picture of the first one, potato pancakes, which opens a new tab that brings her to the recipe page. She brings out all the ingredients that are required for the recipe and follows the recipe to make the dish. Her dish is a success and she wakes her kids up to eat breakfast. Her kids are delighted to see that it is a new dish and love it. Mary is happy and satisfied that her kids seem to like the new dish she has made.
