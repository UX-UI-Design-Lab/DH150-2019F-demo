#### DH150: UX+UI, by Hermann Hesse

### Introduction

Deok_UP is an app to teach Korean through Korean Popular Culture Content. Deok_UP (덕업) is from the word 덕후 in Korean that means "fan" and 업 is a play on the word "UP" pronounced as 업 in Korean, but also a way to allude at the expression "덕업일치" that means "when something you enjoy becomes your work." - This saying kind of reflects well my wish to make people able to reach their personal/professional goal of learning Korean in an enjoyable way, and that's why I decided this name.

### Design statement: 

With the COVID-19 pandemic, we have entered a period of time when people are facing instability and uncertainty. As Los Angeles continues to be in a state of lockdown, more people are experiencing negative emotions such as anxiety and fear. Although middle-aged women are not usually under the spotlight of the social realm of discussion, they are a group that cannot be neglected. Focusing on the happiness of middle-aged women, I hope to, in this project, explore a way of providing an outlet of the real world. By improving the user experience, it can make sure these users can find the process of using the product enjoyable and that the overall experience brings happiness.

### Competitor analysis: Heuristic Evaluation

Designing a new and accessible website for libraries in the midst of a pandemic is significant in continuing to help patrons. Many are sheltering at home and institutions, such as libraries, remain closed to the public and;therefore, are forced to redesign their services. With services going online, the digital divide is apparent. It makes it more difficult when a library's websites are difficult to navigate and overwhelming to use. Focusing on the two major library systems in Los Angeles, I will be evaulating both Los Angeles Public Library and LA County Library's website in order to design a more simple and easy to use website for middle-age patron who indentify as female.

### Competitor analysis: Usability Testing
The purpose of usability testing (UT) is to identify issues with the product design and improve the overall usability and satisfaction of a product. In contrast to heuristic evaluation, UT provides a more accurate inspection of how a random participant would interact with a product. It is necessary to test whether a product is effective, efficient, and satisfactory for users. The UT process can also inform potential users about the unreleased project, as well as help identify problems in the interface early, eliminating possible future spending and damage control.
