# Glassbead Game
## DH110 project by Herman Hesse

### Introduction
To bridge the generation gap between the youth and elders, I wanted to explore the idea of creating a service and digital space that will allow both age groups to communicate and form relationships through a video chat feature, not only to create companionship and mitigate stigmas that each group may have on the other, but also to encourage an efficient and accessible way for people to meet others with diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and abilities.

### Design statement 
According to the United Nations, the number of seniors (65+) is expected to double to 1.5 billion by 2050 globally. Despite seniors being one of the fastest-growing and wealthiest demographics in wealthy countries, many digital products fail to meet senior accessibility needs and have made them feel excluded from an online world that is unfriendly to those with bad eyesight, declined dexterity, and unfamiliarity with the web. In particular, health is a major concern among seniors, and we should ensure that information is accessible to them. For this project, I hope to demonstrate how we can improve user (patient) experiences on websites with health, healthcare, and patient information so that seniors can maintain their well-being.

### Competitor analysis: Heuristic Evaluation

I will conduct a heuristic evaluation of two websites with goals similar to the ones of this project. The first, TimeSlips, allows seniors to write creative stories. The second, The Life Writer, provides a way for seniors to write a memoir book. The evaluation will discuss each site's adherence to the [10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) and provide [Severity Ratings for Usability Problems](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/) with consideration for the target users, senior citizens.

### Competitor analysis: Usability Testing
I set up the usability testing with an introduction, informed consent, background questions, pre-test questions, three tasks, post-test questionnaire, system usability scale (SUS), production satisfaction card, and personal questions. The entire process was conducted on Google Forms.
The majority of the measurements used were ease-of-use, and the website’s functionality, i.e. how easy was each task for the user? was the user able to find exact information to make them feel confident about make decisions or knowing their rights as a senior employee in the workplace.

### User research [contextual inquiry]
I used a direct interview and participatory observation methods. For the interview, I asked about my participant's tech use and motivation to share his story. For the participatory observation, I walked him through The Life Writer to gauge his tech fluency and see how the website could be made better for him.

Overall, this activity was really helpful and fulfilled the two goals I set:
Gauge my participant's desire for storytelling.
My participant expressed a desire to share his story if he has a willing audience. He named his wife, daughter, and granddaughter as people who would potentially be interested in hearing his experiences, things he's done, things he's done wrong, and things that make him happy (2:46).
Assess my participant's fluency and comfort with technology.
He is familiar with technology, as he spends about five hours per week on his laptop and 2 hours a day on his phone to check messages from his friends, pay bills, and research things (0:39 - 1:18). However, he seemed to need a lot of help navigating the website. Though he said the website was pretty easy to use and not overwhelming (26:14 - 26:34), he needed help making an account and figuring out what to click on at times. [>> read more by Joy Hsieh](#)


### UX storytelling 
From what I learned from my user interviews and research, some elderly may not favor going to doctor so I focused on two contrasting personalities and views on healthcare but they possess the lack of technological experience.

### Wireframe and graphic design element variation 
Typography
My font is MADE Evolve Sans, a clean san serif with Bold, Medium, Regular, and Light versions. The font is easy on the eyes and very versatile. The Bold is great for titles while the Regular is perfect for paragraph text. Title fonts in my app are 30pt and paragraph is 16pt. Smaller detailed text such as prices for parts ar 12pt.
Colors
I wanted to keep the colors very simple and almost monochrome. Black gives the impression of luxury and quality, which is what I want my users to feel when using the app and assembling their PC. A bright blue was chosen as an accent color, but I have yet to find subtle ways to work it into the UI design. The bright green was chosen as the "Compatibility" color. In future screens, I will use this color to show that all the parts are compatible together.
Layout
The layout of this app is designed for vertical scrolling. The spacing between most text and images is 15 pixels. [>> read more by Joie Cao](#)



### Low-fidelity prototype
According to the previous usability test and the interview, people from the targeted community are not too satisfied and seek improvement with the current methods of job boards. After gathering insights from previous testings, these are the features that can mitigate the dissatisfaction and be geared towards a significant improvement.
Advanced filters - More specified filters that include more options for location (ex: west, south-west, east, etc), students (position for student/non-student), title and description (flexible and more advanced ways of including certain words). A platform that unites all the job board websites' job postings into this app/website so the user can get the latest and earliest possible updates
Personalized record - The automated list of the companies users applied organized and managed from the system; users can always come back to this list and refresh their memories on job descriptions or the date they applied
Follow-up Notification on application: If the company hasn't responded after a month, users receive a notification and can choose different possible options: either cold email the companies or discard that job application (cross out from the list).

### High-fidelity prototype (functional/interactive prototype)


### evaluation and revision history 
I conducted four usability tests among my classmates to detect major problems and objectively see, from a user’s perspective, how the product works. These usability tests were conducted over Zoom and with the permission of the participants, their screen and facial expressions were recorded. 

Main Findings:

All participants were able to complete the three tasks.
Home screen fonts were too small.
Some participants had a hard time getting to the “done” button after adding a book to their “want to read” bookshelf.
Some participants had a hard time finding the “share” button.
The “write a book log” was the function least likely to be used by these participants.
Adjectives used the most frequently to describe this app were: creative, familiar, and trustworthy.

### Conclusion 
I learned several things during my DH 150 project on the UCLA Bruins app: [read more by Josh Mimura](https://joshmimura.github.io/DH-150-Assignments/final/)

User-based Evidence: I learned that understanding user experience means trying to position yourself as best you can inside the users mind rather than speculating as to what users prefer. It is easy to project your opinions and understanding of design onto users, but the designer is always biased. The only way to make constructive design choices is to actually produce data based on a user’s behavior (through user testing, field research, pathway testing, etc.) and to use this data to better understand the user’s experience.
Graphical Interface Accessibility: I learned that graphical interface choices are very scientific and technical. I previously did not know anything about color schemes or geometric nudging, but this project has taught me that everything on the interface must be deliberate and must meet certain accessibility standards. I now know that colors that have a text-background relationship must have a contrast ratio greater than 4.5:1 for them to be distinguished clearly for all users.
Tradeoffs: UX design is all about tradeoffs. In choosing whether or not to include certain information into my designs, I was constantly faced with dilemmas: do I add more information and make the interface slightly more cluttered, or do I retain the minimalist look at the expense of the interfaces informativeness? In the end, it was about finding the right balance in every decision I made. Thus, I learned that you cannot have everything, and the tradeoffs you make will largely depend on the function of certain elements and the purpose of your app (e.g. I prioritized information over minimalism on the team profile interface because this interface is meant to inform the user on a team’s season performance.)
Don’t Use Pen: Prototyping and wireframe development is full of mistakes, redos, and tinkering. They involve a large amount of time crossing things out and modifying small things about the interface. I learned that these processes just take time and can be quite tedious, so the designer needs to become comfortable with never feeling 100% content with any given prototype. In sum, don’t use a pen because the final product is never really final.
Importance of Internal Consistency: When developing the high-fidelity prototype, I realized that many of my design elements were not consistent. For example, some rectangles had a 90-degree edge radius while others had smooth edges. I noted that this inconsistency made my interfaces seem clunky and unprofessional. Thus, I learned that internal consistency can go a long way in increasing the legitimacy of you prototype.
