# Glassbead Game
## DH110 project by Herman Hesse

### Introduction
To bridge the generation gap between the youth and elders, I wanted to explore the idea of creating a service and digital space that will allow both age groups to communicate and form relationships through a video chat feature, not only to create companionship and mitigate stigmas that each group may have on the other, but also to encourage an efficient and accessible way for people to meet others with diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and abilities.

### Design statement 
According to the United Nations, the number of seniors (65+) is expected to double to 1.5 billion by 2050 globally. Despite seniors being one of the fastest-growing and wealthiest demographics in wealthy countries, many digital products fail to meet senior accessibility needs and have made them feel excluded from an online world that is unfriendly to those with bad eyesight, declined dexterity, and unfamiliarity with the web. In particular, health is a major concern among seniors, and we should ensure that information is accessible to them. For this project, I hope to demonstrate how we can improve user (patient) experiences on websites with health, healthcare, and patient information so that seniors can maintain their well-being.

### Competitor analysis: Heuristic Evaluation

I will conduct a heuristic evaluation of two websites with goals similar to the ones of this project. The first, TimeSlips, allows seniors to write creative stories. The second, The Life Writer, provides a way for seniors to write a memoir book. The evaluation will discuss each site's adherence to the [10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) and provide [Severity Ratings for Usability Problems](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/) with consideration for the target users, senior citizens.
